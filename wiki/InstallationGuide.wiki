#Installation Gude.

= Introduction =

Quizzer is a multi-modules project that uses [http://maven.apache.org  Apache Maven] as build and dependency management system. So you need to install Maven in order to get started.

= Installing Maven=

You can install Maven as a standalone application (command line) or, if you are using Eclipse IDE, you can have it integrating inside Eclipse (which is more convenient).

Personnaly, i recommend both.


== Installing Maven as standalone application ==

Follow instructions [http://maven.apache.org/download.html here].

== Installing Maven as Eclipse Plugin ==

Here are the steps required:

 *Go to Help Menu -> Eclipse Market place...
 *Search "maven" and select "Maven Integration for WTP"
