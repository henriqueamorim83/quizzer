#Installation Gude.

= Introduction =

Quizzer is a multi-modules project, that uses [http://maven.apache.org  Apache Maven] as build and dependency management system. So you need to install Maven in order to get started.

= Installing Maven=

You can install Maven as a standalone application (that you will run via command line) or, if you are using Eclipse IDE, you can have it integrated inside Eclipse (which is more convenient).

Personnaly, i recommend both.


== Installing Maven as standalone application ==

Follow instructions from Maven official site [http://maven.apache.org/download.html here].

== Installing Maven as Eclipse Plugin ==

You need to install the <b>"Maven Integration for WTP"</b> plugin.
This will allows you to easily import, create,and manage maven project from within Eclipse.

Here are the steps required:

 *Go to Help Menu -> Eclipse Market place...
 *Search "maven" and select "Maven Integration for WTP"

 *Click 'Next'. 

          

 *In the next screen, browse to the folder that contains "quizzer" root directory. If everything went well, you should have 4 pom.xml files listed as such:

 *You can uncheck the first pom.xml element, as it is not really a project, but just the parent pom.xml file, that declares.
